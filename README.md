# Color_Detection_and_Sorter

Implementing real-time color detection in Python with OpenCV  to compute optimized joint trajectories, and calibrated gripper motions for reliable pick-and-place of small objects in variable lighting. Designed a modular software architecture to handle vision, trajectory planning, and actuation, demonstrating expertise in sensor integration, computer vision, and embedded motion control.
